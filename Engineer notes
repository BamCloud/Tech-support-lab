Engineer Notes:
- Wrote PowerShell script to create new user profile when corruption can't be fixed (included).
New-profie.ps1
 PowerShell script I used to create a new user profile

$Username = Read-Host "Ade"
$Password = Read-Host "Enter password" -AsSecureString

# Create local user
New-LocalUser -Name $Username -Password $Password -FullName "$Username - Temp" -Description "New profile for corrupted user"

# Add to Users group
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Users" -Member $Username

Write-Host "New user profile created. Instruct user to log in with new credentials."
